# finviz-web-scraper
The purpose behind building this web scraper was to scrape a website called finviz (stock data) and input all data into a postgresql database table. Then I needed to get the avg of of the market_cap column.

Use psycopg2 package within python to execute SQL statements.
Also, you will need to know how to set up your postgresql database, I will post how I did that later for Ubuntu.
